Abstract:
In our project, we'll be designing a sequential logic game, such as a memory game.Users must follow a sequence of LED flashes or button presses, and logic gates can
control the game's logic. The initial sequence will be displayed with the help of LEDs. The playerâ€™s input will be taken using pushbuttons. If the input and the
sequence matches, the next sequence flashes and the player is asked to either input the current or previous sequence to add to the challenge.
In this project, we present the development of an interactive game system that creates a dynamic and engaging user experience. The primary objective of this project is to design and implement a digital circuit that displays a randomized sequence of LED patterns and validates user input to assess correctness. It offers a unique blend of hardware design, gaming, and user interaction, making it a compelling and engaging project, allowing for an exciting and variable gameplay. Key components of the project include modules for generating random sequences, controlling LEDs to display patterns, capturing user input, and implementing validation logic.
We were motivated to do this project as in today's world full of stress, gaming is an outlet for people to relax. We are implementing a simple form of this relaxation for people to play while also testing their memory.
